# typescript-grumbling

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a fantastic language. I owe a great debt to the TypeScript team for making my life better.

For me, TypeScript is second only to [Vortex](https://vortexlang.com). I created Vortex though, so that's not exactly fair. Realistically, Vortex needs a lot of work, and TypeScript is king.

Anyway, I am cataloging my grumbles about TypeScript here. There are things that I wish were different about TypeScript. I'm aware that some of these things are intentional design choices.
